## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Saddam Hussein (28 April 1937 – 30 December 2006) 
> was an Iraqi politician and revolutionary 
> who served as the president of Iraq from 1979 
> until he was overthrown in 2003 during the U.S. invasion of Iraq. 
> 
> He previously served as the vice president from 1968 to 1979 
> and also as the prime minister from 1979 to 1991 and later from 1994 to 2003. 
> 
> A leading member of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, he was a proponent of Ba'athism, 
> a mix of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism. 
> The policies and political ideas he championed are collectively known as Saddamism.
>
> Born near the city of Tikrit to a Sunni Arab family, 
> Saddam Hussein  joined the revolutionary Ba'ath Party in 1957. 
> He played a key role in the 17 July Revolution that brought the Ba'athists to power in Iraq 
> and made him vice president under Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. 
> 
> During his tenure as vice president, Saddam nationalized the Iraq Petroleum Company, 
> diversified the economy, introduced free healthcare and education, 
> and supported women's rights. 
> 
> He also presided over the defeat of the Kurdish insurgency in the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War 
> and signed the Algiers Agreement with Iran in 1975, 
> thereby settling territorial disputes along the Iran–Iraq border. 
> 
> Following al-Bakr's resignation in 1979, Saddam formally took power. 
> During his presidency, positions of power in the country were mostly filled with Sunni Arabs, a minority that made up only about a fifth of the Iraqi population.
>
> Upon taking office as president in 1979, Saddam purged rivals within his party. 
> In 1980, he ordered the invasion of Iran, 
> purportedly to capture Iran's Arab-majority Khuzestan province, 
> and end Iranian attempts to export its Islamic Revolution to the Arab world. 
> 
> In 1988, as the war with Iran ended in a stalemate, 
> he ordered the Anfal campaign against Kurdish rebels who had sided with Iran. 
> 
> Later, he accused his former ally Kuwait of slant-drilling Iraq's oil reserves 
> and subsequently invaded the country in 1990. 
> 
> This ultimately led to the Gulf War in 1991, 
> which ended in Iraq's defeat by a United States-led coalition. 
> 
> In the war's aftermath, Saddam's forces suppressed the 1991 Iraqi uprisings 
> launched by Kurds and Shi'as seeking regime change, as well as further uprisings in 1999. 
> 
> After reconsolidating his hold on power, Saddam pursued an Islamist agenda for Iraq 
> through the Faith Campaign. 
> 
> In 2003, a US-led coalition invaded Iraq, 
> incorrectly accusing him of developing weapons of mass destruction 
> and of having ties with al-Qaeda. 
> 
> Coalition forces toppled Saddam's regime and captured him. 
> During his trial, Saddam was convicted by the Iraqi High Tribunal 
> of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging. 
> He was executed on 30 December 2006.
>
> A polarizing and controversial figure, Saddam dominated Iraqi politics for 35 years 
> and was the subject of a cult of personality. 
> 
> Many Arabs regard Saddam as a resolute leader who challenged Western imperialism, 
> opposed the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and resisted foreign intervention in the region. 
> 
> Conversely, many Iraqis, particularly Shi'as and Kurds, 
> perceive him as a tyrant responsible for acts of repression, mass killing and other injustices. 
> 
> Human Rights Watch estimated that Saddam's regime was 
> responsible for the murder or disappearance of 250,000 to 290,000 Iraqis. 
> 
> Saddam's government has been described by several analysts as 
> authoritarian and totalitarian, and by some as fascist, 
> although the applicability of those labels has been contested.
