> **Ur** was a major Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, 
> located at the site of modern Tell el-Muqayyar (Arabic: تَلّ ٱلْمُقَيَّر, lit. 'mound of bitumen') 
> in Dhi Qar Governorate, [[Iraq]]. 
> 
> Although Ur was a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf, 
> the coastline has shifted and the site is now well inland, 
> on the south bank of the Euphrates, 16 km (10 mi) southwest of the city of Nasiriyah. 
> 
> The city dates from the Ubaid period c. 3800 BC, and is recorded in written history as a city-state from the 26th century BC, its first recorded king being Mesannepada.
>
> The city's patron deity was the moon god Nanna (Sin in Akkadian), 
> and the name of the city is derived from UNUGKI, literally "the abode (of Nanna)". 
> 
> The site is marked by the partially restored ruins of the Ziggurat of Ur, 
> which contained the shrine of Nanna, excavated in the 1930s. 
> 
> The temple was built in the 21st century BC (short chronology), 
> during the reign of Ur-Nammu and was reconstructed in the 6th century BC 
> by Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon. 
> 
> In recent years, Ur Tourist City, a modern heritage and tourism district, 
> has been developed adjacent to the site to accommodate tourists and pilgrims.
