## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Babylonia** (; Akkadian: 𒆳𒆍𒀭𒊏𒆠, māt Akkadī) was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state 
> and cultural area based on the city of Babylon in central-southern Mesopotamia 
> (present-day Iraq and parts of Kuwait, Syria and Iran). 
> 
> It emerged as an Akkadian-populated but Amorite-ruled state c. 1894 BC. 
> During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, 
> Babylonia was retrospectively called "the country of Akkad" (māt Akkadī in Akkadian), 
> a deliberate archaism in reference to the previous glory of the Akkadian Empire. 
> 
> It was often involved in rivalry with the older ethno-linguistically related state of Assyria in the north of Mesopotamia and Elam to the east in Ancient Iran. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi (fl. c. 1792–1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696–1654 BC, short chronology) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire, Third Dynasty of Ur, and Old Assyrian Empire. The Babylonian Empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi and reverted to a small kingdom centered around the city of Babylon.
>
> Like Assyria, the Babylonian state retained the written Akkadian language (the language of its native populace) for official use, despite its Northwest Semitic-speaking Amorite founders and Kassite successors, who spoke a language isolate, not being native Mesopotamians. It retained the Sumerian language for religious use (as did Assyria which also shared the same Mesopotamian religion as Babylonia), but already by the time Babylon was founded, this was no longer a spoken language, having been wholly subsumed by Akkadian. The earlier Akkadian and Sumerian traditions played a major role in the descendant Babylonian and Assyrian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under its protracted periods of outside rule.
