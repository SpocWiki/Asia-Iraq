> **Hillah** (Arabic: ٱلْحِلَّة al-Ḥillah), also spelled Hilla, is a city in central Iraq. 
> On the Hilla branch of the Euphrates River, it is 100 km (62 mi) south of Baghdad. 
> The population was estimated to be about 455,700 in 2018. 
> 
> It is the capital of Babylon Province and is situated in a predominantly agricultural region 
> which is extensively irrigated with water provided by the Hilla canal, 
> producing a wide range of crops, fruit and textiles. 
> 
> Its name may be derived from the word "beauty" in Arabic. 
> The river runs in the middle of the town, 
> and it is surrounded by date palm trees and other forms of arid vegetation, 
> reducing the harmful effects of dust and desert wind.
>
> The city is located adjacent to the ancient city of Babylon, 
> and close to the ancient cities of Borsippa and Kish. 
> It was once a major centre of Islamic scholarship and education. 
> 
> The tomb of the Abrahamic prophet Ezekiel is reputed to be located in a nearby village, Al Kifl. 
> 
> It became a major administrative centre during the rule of the Ottoman and British Empires. 
> In the 19th century, the Hilla branch of the Euphrates started to silt up 
> and much agricultural land was lost to drought, 
> but this process was reversed by the construction of the Hindiya Barrage in 1911–1913, 
> which diverted water from the deeper Hindiya branch of the Euphrates into the Hilla canal. 
> It saw heavy fighting in 1920 during an uprising against the British, 
> when 300 men of the Manchester Regiment were defeated in the city.
